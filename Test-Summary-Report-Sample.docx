Test Summary Report

Project Name: Online Banking Application
Test Cycle: Cycle 3 – Regression Testing
Version: v3.2.1
Date: October 7, 2025
Prepared By: QA Team
Reviewed By: Test Manager

1. Objective
The objective of this test cycle was to perform regression testing on the Online Banking Application after the integration of new features—Funds Transfer Enhancements and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)—and to ensure that existing functionalities were not affected.

2. Scope
• In-Scope:
  o Login and Authentication
  o Funds Transfer Module
  o Account Summary
  o Transaction History
• Out-of-Scope:
  o Mobile App Version (Testing planned for next release)
  o Performance and Load Testing

3. Test Summary
Item	Description
Total Test Cases Planned	250
Total Test Cases Executed	245
Test Cases Passed	230
Test Cases Failed	10
Test Cases Blocked	5
Execution Rate	98%
Pass Percentage	94%

4. Defect Summary
Defect Severity	Count	Status
Critical	2	Fixed & Verified
Major	5	Fixed & Verified
Minor	6	Deferred to Next Release
Total	13
Defect Density: 0.05 defects per test case
Major Root Causes: Configuration issues, validation logic errors, and minor UI inconsistencies.

5. Environment Details
Component	Description
Test Environment	QA Server 2
OS	Windows Server 2022
Database	MySQL 8.0
Browser	Chrome 129, Edge 128
Build Version	Build_2025.10.05

6. Observations and Key Findings
• The new 2FA feature performed as expected under normal and edge conditions.
• Minor UI alignment issues were identified on smaller screen resolutions.
• Funds Transfer validation logic failed under certain negative scenarios—fixed in Patch 3.2.1.1

7. Risks and Mitigations
Risk	Impact	Mitigation
Deferred defects may affect user experience in rare cases	Low	Plan for quick fix in next patch cycle
Limited device coverage in this cycle	Medium	Include mobile devices in next regression cycle

8. Metrics
• Defect Leakage Rate: 2%
• Test Execution Productivity: 45 test cases/day/tester
• Automation Coverage: 60% of regression suite

9. Lessons Learned
• Early environment setup improved test execution efficiency.
• Better coordination with development reduced retest delays.
• Test data reusability should be enhanced for faster turnaround.

10. Conclusion
All major functionalities have been verified, and the application meets the defined acceptance criteria. The system is recommended for UAT (User Acceptance Testing), with minor issues deferred to the next release.
