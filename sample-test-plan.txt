Test Plan ID: TP-2025-INV-01
Project Name: Invoice Management System (IMS)
Version: 1.0
Prepared By: QA Lead â€“ John Doe
Date: 06-Oct-2025
Reviewers: Project Manager, Dev Lead, Business Analyst

1. Introduction
The purpose of this test plan is to define the testing approach for the Invoice Management System (IMS). IMS is a web-based application designed to automate invoice generation, approvals, payments, and reporting. The goal is to ensure that the system meets all functional, non-functional, and security requirements before deployment.

2. Test Items (Modules/Features to be Tested)
- User Authentication (Login/Logout)
- Invoice Creation
- Invoice Approval Workflow
- Payment Integration (via Stripe)
- Reporting Dashboard
- Notifications (Email/SMS)

3. Features to be Tested
- Secure user login and role-based access
- Creation of new invoices with line-item details
- Auto-calculation of tax, discount, and total
- Approval workflow (multi-level)
- Integration with Stripe for payments
- Invoice status updates (draft, pending, approved, paid)
- Report generation based on filters (date, client, status)
- Email alerts for invoice submission and approval

4. Features Not to be Tested
- Stripe internal processing (assumed tested by Stripe)
- 3rd-party email/SMS delivery after API success
- UI color scheme and branding consistency (covered by UI/UX team)
- Performance under 10,000 concurrent users (outside current scope)

5. Test Strategy
Testing Levels: Unit Testing (Dev), Integration Testing, System Testing, Regression, UAT
Testing Types:
- Functional Testing
- Regression Testing
- API Testing (Postman)
- Smoke Testing
- Compatibility Testing (Browser)
- Security Testing (basic OWASP checks)

6. Test Deliverables

QA Engineer 1	Jane Smith	Test Design, Execution
QA Engineer 2	Arun Patel	Regression, Automation
Dev Support	Ahmed Khan	Defect Fixes & Build Support
Business Analyst	Maria Gomez	Requirement Clarification

11. Tools & Automation Approach

- Automation Tool: Selenium WebDriver + TestNG (Java)
- API Testing: Postman Collections
- CI/CD Integration: Jenkins (Smoke Suite on every build)
- Reporting: Extent Reports for automation; JIRA dashboards for manual

12. Risk and Contingency Plan
Risk	Mitigation
Requirements change mid-sprint	Freeze scope for current test cycle
Delay in test environment setup	Use local test environments temporarily
Unavailability of test data	Create mock data using scripts
High defect volume in integration phase	Prioritize blockers and coordinate with dev
Resource availability due to overlapping projects	Escalate early and reallocate if necessary
